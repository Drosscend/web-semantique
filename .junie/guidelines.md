# Project Guidelines for Junie

## Project Overview
This project implements a Column Type Annotation (CTA) algorithm that automatically determines the semantic type of each column in a CSV file using Wikidata and DBpedia knowledge bases. The application is written in TypeScript and uses Bun as its runtime environment.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the source code of the application
  - `index.ts`: Main entry point of the application
  - `config.ts`: Configuration settings for the application
  - `logger.ts`: Logging utility
  - `modules/`: Contains the functional modules for each step of the algorithm
    - `dataPreparation.ts`: Functions for loading and cleaning CSV data
    - `dataCorrection.ts`: Functions for correcting and standardizing data
    - `entitySearch.ts`: Functions for searching entities in knowledge bases
    - `typeMapping.ts`: Functions for mapping between DBpedia and Wikidata types
    - `columnRelationship.ts`: Functions for analyzing relationships between columns
    - `uriAnalysis.ts`: Functions for analyzing URIs
    - `typeExtraction.ts`: Functions for extracting types for each entity
    - `typeAggregation.ts`: Functions for aggregating and voting on final types
  - `services/`: Contains services for interacting with external APIs
  - `types/`: Contains TypeScript type definitions
  - `tests/`: Contains test files
- `data/`: Contains example CSV files
- `output/`: Contains output files generated by the application
- `dist/`: Contains compiled JavaScript files

## Running the Application
The application can be run using Bun:
```bash
bun run src\index.ts <path-to-csv-file> [output-path] [options]
```

## Testing
When making changes to the code, Junie should run tests to verify that the changes don't break existing functionality. Tests can be run using:
```bash
bun test
```

If the changes involve modifying the algorithm's behavior, Junie should also test the application with example CSV files to ensure that the annotations are still correct:
```bash
bun run src\tests\test.ts
```

## Building the Project
Before submitting changes, Junie should build the project to ensure that the TypeScript code compiles correctly:
```bash
bun build src/index.ts --outdir dist
```

## Code Style
The project uses Biome for code formatting and linting. Junie should ensure that any code changes follow the project's code style guidelines. The following commands can be used to format and lint the code:
```bash
# Format code
bun run format

# Lint code
bun run lint
```

## Making Changes
When making changes to the code, Junie should:
1. Understand the existing code and its purpose
2. Make minimal changes to fix the issue or implement the feature
3. Ensure that the changes don't break existing functionality by running tests
4. Format and lint the code to ensure it follows the project's style guidelines
5. Build the project to ensure that the TypeScript code compiles correctly
6. Update the readme.md file if adding new features or making significant changes
7. Update the help section in index.ts if the changes affect how users interact with the application
8. Provide a clear explanation of the changes made

### Documentation Updates
When adding new features or making significant changes to the project:
- Update the readme.md file to document the new features or changes
- Update the help section in index.ts if the changes affect command-line arguments or usage
- Ensure that the documentation is consistent across all files
- Write documentation in French for user-facing content (readme.md, help text) and in English for developer-facing content (guidelines.md, code comments)
